  <hr>

  <p>I am looking for <b>multiple PhD students</b> to start the <b style="color: #b509ac">Princeton Robot Planning and Learning (PRPL)</b> lab. Prospective students should apply to either <a href="https://ece.princeton.edu/academics/graduate/apply">ECE</a> or <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/grad">CS</a> and mention my name.
  </p>

  <p>I am not hiring students for specific projects. I am looking for people who are generally interested in robots, planning, and learning. Most of all, I want to build a diverse group aligned around the <b style="color: #b509ac">PRPL mission</b>:</p>

  <center><p><b style="color: #b509ac">Develop generalist robots that learn and plan to help people.</b></p></center>
  
  <p>Please read my <a href="/assets/pdf/tom_silver_research2024.pdf">research statement</a> to learn more about my vision for the group.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>See the admissions websites for <a href="https://ece.princeton.edu/academics/graduate/apply">ECE</a> or <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/grad">CS</a> for additional FAQs.</p>

  <h5>Can I contact you directly?</h5>
  <p>Feel free to email me, but please mention why you are specifically interested in my lab.</p>

  <h5>Should I apply to ECE or CS?</h5>
  <p>I can advise students in either department, so you can apply to whichever makes the most sense for you.</p>

  <h5>Can I waive Princeton's application fee?</h5>
  <p>The graduate program has an application fee, but you can <a href="https://gradschool.princeton.edu/admission-onboarding/prepare/deadlines-and-fees">request for this fee to be waived</a>. If your request is denied and the fee presents a financial hardship, you can contact me directly and I'll do my best to help figure something out.</p>

  <h5>What is your advising style?</h5>
  <p>Check out the "Teaching and Mentorship Prerequisites" section of my <a href="/assets/pdf/tom_silver_teaching2024.pdf">teaching statement</a> to get a sense. I also fully agree with everything Ani says in <a href="https://animajumdar.substack.com/p/i-am-your-phd-advisor-but-what-does">his blog post</a>.</p> 

  <h5>Are you hiring postdocs?</h5>
  <p>I am not actively looking for a postdoc, but if the right person comes along, I will be opportunistic. Please contact me if you are such a person.</p>

  <h5>I am not ready for a PhD or Postdoc. Are there any other opportunities in your group?</h5>
  <p>If you are a current Princeton student interested in research in my group, please contact me. I don't have other open positions at this time.</p>
