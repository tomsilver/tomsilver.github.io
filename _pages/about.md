I am a final year PhD student at MIT EECS. My research is motivated by the prospect of <b>broadly-competent</b>, <b>helpful</b>, and <b>intelligent</b> robots that can respond to very high-level commands like "make me a heart-healthy dinner"; learn new skills like "grind fresh pepper"; and learn new concepts like "wilted spinach." Such robots will be especially transformative for people who cannot otherwise remain independent in their homes. Most of my work is at the intersection of automated planning and machine learning: <b>learning to plan</b> and <b>planning to learn</b> while making <b>efficient</b> use of limited data and time. I often use techniques from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01083">task and motion planning</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06317">program synthesis</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10680">neuro-symbolic machine learning</a>.

At MIT, I am advised by Leslie Kaelbling and Joshua Tenenbaum and am a member of the <a href="https://lis.csail.mit.edu/">Learning and Intelligent Systems</a> group and the <a href="https://cocosci.mit.edu/">Computational Cognitive Science</a> group. Previously I was a researcher at Vicarious AI. I received my B.A. from Harvard with highest honors in computer science and mathematics in 2016. I have also interned at Google Research (Brain Robotics) and currently split my time between MIT and the <a href="https://theaiinstitute.com/">Boston Dynamics AI Institute</a>. I am grateful for support from an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and an MIT Presidential Fellowship.
